\section{Testing and Experiment}

This section discusses the testing scheme done in order to make sure the system
has met all feature requirements and it's working as intended. This secion also
further discusses the experimentation done on the system.

\subsection{Testing Scheme}

For the testing, four aspects will be tested. The four aspects are application,
data, end-to-end auto mode, and end-to-end override mode. The test cases for each
aspects can be seen in table \ref{tab-test-cases}.

\subsection{Experimental Setup}
In this section, we will describe the experimental setup of the proposed system.
There are two main spaces, which are a closed room and the outside of the room.
These two spaces are partitioned by a door and/or a window. Inside the room,
DHT22 sensor is placed to measure the temperature and humidity of the room.
Outside the room, MQ135 sensor is placed to measure the CO$_2$ ppm outside the room.
A servo motor is placed to open and close the door/window.
Experimental setup of the system can be seen in figure \ref{setup}.

\begin{figure}
      \centerline{\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{resources/setup.png}}
      \caption{Experimental setup of the smart room air conditioner}
      \label{setup}
\end{figure}

Control setup of the system is when the door is open and all sensors are
indicating normal values or within an acceptable range. This system is will be
tested in the following scenarios:
\begin{enumerate}
      \item Using auto mode, a match will be lit and placed near the MQ135 sensor
            in order to increase the CO$_2$ ppm outside the room. The door should
            be closed to prevent bad air from coming in.
      \item Using auto mode, a match will be lit and placed near the DHT22 sensor
            to increase the temperature/humidity inside the room. The door should
            should be opened to let fresh air in.
      \item Using override mode, a match will be lit and placed near the MQ135
            sensor in order to increase the CO$_2$ ppm outside the room. If the door
            is opened, an email will be sent to warn the user to close the door.
      \item Using override mode, a match will be lit and placed near the DHT22
            sensor to increase the temperature/humidity inside the room. If the door
            is closed, an email will be sent to warn the user to open the door.
\end{enumerate}
